# What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows users to work with that data efficiently. It's categorized as a NoSQL database because the storage and retrieval of data is not in the form of tables.

## How it works

Data is stored in the collections and documents rather than tables. The database, collection, and documents are related to each other as shown below:

In a SQL database tables can have multiple rows and columns. Similarly in MongoDB a collection can have multiple documents which are equivalent to rows. Each document can have multiple "fields" which are equivalent to the columns.

Here's an example of a JSON based document:

Advantages: 
- Stores data as JSON based documents that do not enforce schema allowing hierarchical data in a ddocument. This makes storing and retrieving data easy and efficient.
- Easy to scale up or down.
- Allows data to be split across multiple servers.
- Has features like indexing, aggregation, file store, and more.
- Performs fast with huge data.
- Provide drivers to store and fetch data from different apps developed in different technologies such as C#, Java, Python, Node.js, etc.
